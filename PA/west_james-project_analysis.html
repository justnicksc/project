      <h1>Client: Nick's<br />
        Designer: James West<br />
        Project: New Site Creation</h1>

 
      <h1>Site intent</h1>
      <p>Established in 2001 Nick's is one of Columbia's best 								Authentic Italian restaurant. Nick's prides itself in making only 		scratch made dishes and never frozen ingredients. In fact Nick's use 	herbs from their very own garden. 
        
      <p>There are a few big chain Italian restaurants, but Nick's real competition is Al's upstairs, Pasta Fresco, and Rosso Trattoria Italia.</p>
      <p>Nick's website's purpose is to provide a way for people to learn about what nicks has to offer, view their menu, request a reservation, and check for job openings. The will also be a page with a weekly featured recipe from the chef.</p>
      <p>Since this will be Nick&rsquo;s first website I will be creating not only the website but the content as well. I will create a six page site that will have a clean minimalistic approach but an authentic old world feel. There will be a page that will contain positions that are open and a link to download an application. I will create the menu in a downloadable PDF and one of the pages will be an html version that will be responsive. </p>

        <h1>Competition</h1>
        <p>Most of the local owned Italian restaurants did not have much information available on Alexa.com and none of them had any demographic information. They were in the top ten on google search.</p>
